{"script":"Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high.\\n There's a land that I heard of, once in a lullaby.\\n Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue.\\n \
And the dreams that you dare to dream, really do come true.\\n Someday I'll wish upon a star.\\n Where troubles melt like lemon drops away above the chimney tops.\\n That's where you'll find me.\\n Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly.\\n Birds fly over the rainbow, why then, oh why can't I?.\\n Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly.\\n Birds fly over the rainbow, why then, oh why can't I?.\\n If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow.\\n Why, oh why can't I?."\}\
